### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science major studying at the University of Kentucky.

I've been writing C code since I was 13 years old and am familiar with the family up to C++20 (Spaceship operator, concepts...)

I've contributed a fair number of projects to the free software world. I have tried to put as many of them as I can on github, although the nature by which I create experimental projects causes them to be in clumps. None of my projects have been all that incredible, but they are free.

I have also donated a significant amount of my time contributing to public free software projects.
