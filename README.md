I'm a computer science major studying at the University of Kentucky. My hobbies:

* Making digital visual art.
* Writing C, occasionally Javascript. I will work on C++ projects occasionally.
* Working out. Lifting.
* Making music (Not very *good* music, mind you...)
* Listening to banger tunes from the nineties.
* Reading. My favorite Author is Robert Asprin.

I've been writing C code since I was 13 years old and am familiar with the C family up to C++20 (Spaceship operator, concepts...).

Yes, I can write C++. I find some of the design decisions... questionable at best. C++ and OOP in general tends to involve a lot of anti-patterns that make code harder to read and harder to maintain. A nice C++ codebase is a hard find.

I've contributed a fair number of projects to the free software world. Not all of them are on my Github, but certainly the ones i've contributed the most to. I have forked a couple repositories without any modifications on occasion, purely as a sign of respect and interest.
  
The project I feel is of the most interest as a Computer Science topic is my own architecture and programming language, SISA16, which I devised as a way of writing cross-platform low-level code. It is a von-neumann architecture capable of self-modifying code. It has two privilege levels (privileged and user) and the ability to define a memory access offset and mask, which provides the effect of memory mapping. 
  
Sisa16 is advantageous over writing native code, because it can be ported to any platform instantly.


### Yes, I know the basics of devops and web development
I am intimately familiar with PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I've written code
which interacts with SQL databases from PHP and docker containers. If you want to hire me for that, I will not disappoint!

I have written server backend implementations (some of which are on github) using node, deno, docker, nginx, apache2, and even in plain C.

I am able to write apps using javascript with electron and node.
  
I first learned about web development at university but I have had a lot of fun doing it on my own. I have plans to study it further.


### Notable passion projects I have written or contributed to available on my github:
* TinyGL- the penultimate portable graphics library, C99 compatible (Derived from Fabrice Bellard's TinyGL)
* C-Chads- free software programming group I founded.
* SISA16- a fully fleshed out 16/32 bit architecture complete with assembler, disassembler, debugger, emulator, miniature monolithic single-threaded multitasking kernel, and audio/video support. Executes many times faster than lua, almost as fast as V8 with equivalent asm.js code. Has a tiny footprint.
* MHS-FS- A public domain filesystem designed for systems with very little memory which is easy to implement (as filesystems go) and guarantees crash recovery.
* Wallpapers- Wallpapers created for the Debian project, Ubuntu, Arch, Gentoo, and other Linux distributions.
* GSGE- Gek's Simple Game Engine, a free multithreaded, windows/linux/mac game engine which uses OpenGL 3.3, GLFW, GLM, and C++11. One of my oldest projects here on Github (Definitely needs a refactor). Comes with a variety of tools for manipulating OBJ files and defines its own OBJ file format extensions to support per-vertex color and even bone weights. Comes with Blender export scripts for this format as well as the custom animation format of the engine.
* C_GE- Miniature game engine written in pure C99, fully featured lua binding plus physics engine.
* P5_Game- game engine and some sketches, written in P5.js. Also has some fun stuff written with three js and cannon js.
* SDF Tracer- a marching raytracer written in C which is designed to be easily extended.
* ChadMath- a public domain GLU replacement with bonus collision detection routines which is SIMD accelerated by GCC and Clang on supported platforms. (3dMath.h)
* ChadPhys- a public domain physics engine for games (chadphys.h)
* Kernel8/Kernel9- functional intermediate representation language for high-performance secure computing, with an emphasis on parallelism and defined behavior in C11 (Kernel8) and C++11 (Kernel9) respectively.
* tobjparse.h- a tiny public domain C99 OBJ parser capable of parsing GSGE compatible OBJ files, including the vertex color extension.
* AIStateMachines- a custom language for expressing state machines, designed to make writing game logic that is massively parallel much easier.
* OpenIMGUI- an open standard for cross platform immediate mode GUIs with a minimal implementation in TinyGL. Usable example provided.
* TinyGL_3DS- TinyGL on the Nintendo 3DS. Brings a subset of OpenGL to a platform which otherwise does not have a publically available GL implementation. May help people port games to the platform. Needs to be updated from the main TinyGL repository.
* hmap and dhmap.c- Comanche-style Heightmap terrain renderer. The latter actually generates a map on program launch.
* api.h- public domain software rasterizer library and audio wrapper for SDL2.
* api_audio.h- SDL 1.2 port of only the audio portions of api.h.
* gekAL- OpenAL based audio library.
* Fixed Memory Containers- a variety of memory management models and data structures written in C, with special emphasis on fixed-memory implementations which use global structs and arrays.
* bigfont- Linux commandline utility to take text and make it *bigger* for __emphasis__
* Thinput- Ultra-portable input mapping scheme to embed in games which allows users to design their own key bindings of arbitrary complexity, using a custom deterministic bytecode executed at runtime
* LockStepThread- Public domain POSIX threading library which implements a "lock step" thread, very useful for games and game engines.
* Safepointer- Safe memory management scheme for C.
* GodotSaveLoad- saving and loading implementation in gdscript for Godot 3.3
* TinyServer- tiny HTTP server implementation I wrote for CS 270.
* wall- program which makes logo wallpapers using an image and two color ranges.
* noise- program to generate layered noise with operations performed between the layers. Bitwise is funky! Used in conjunction with wall to dynamically generate wallpapers for FOSS projects.
* Many others which I either do not remember or did not think were worth noting on this list.

### Github Activity
I do not understand exactly why, but github sporadically decides not to count my commits as activity on github.

I suspect it is because I use an alias on my machine `gitap` which makes the commit message "Automatic Commit" and because the email tied to my git on my main development machine is `gek@katherine`, which is used when making commits over SSH. It seems to count the pushes that I make via https rather than SSH, though, but Github claims this will be deprecated, so I am trying not to use it.

I make commits to github in fits and bursts when I have ideas or when I'm asked to work on a project.
